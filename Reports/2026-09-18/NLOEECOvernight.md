# Conventional NLO EEC campaign

Started 18 September 2026. Target: the complete massless vector-current EEC at
order alpha_s squared, including both angular endpoints and self correlations.
The project counts orders relative to the two-quark Born process, so the new
raw contributions and result belong under `Projects/EE_EEC/{Raw,Results}/NNLO`.
The accepted order-alpha_s result is conventional LO EEC and is not this target.

## Execution constraints

Use the ordinary cards and general package interfaces. Published EEC coefficients
are independent verification inputs only. Do not put a process-specific formula
or boundary constant in production. Use at most eight aggregate CPU cores and
two main Wolfram kernels. Record supervised elapsed time including startup,
and state whether reductions or library masters were reused.

The existing heartbeat checks this campaign every five minutes for up to eight
hours. Inspect actual jobs before launching anything; never duplicate a running
calculation. Update this record with launch paths, completed stages and failures.

## Initial assessment

The framework already generates current amplitudes and polynomial measurement
cuts, constructs cut IBPs and DEs, and stores physical master solutions. The
complete two/three-particle order-alpha_s EEC calculation is tested. Required
extensions include four-particle physical master boundaries, measured
three-particle one-loop integration, two-particle two-loop and one-loop-squared
terms, and coupling renormalization in the same interval-distribution format.
Flavor sums must include all current attachments without double counting.

Actual GPT-6 Pro is reviewing the mathematical strategy in
[this conversation](https://chatgpt.com/c/6aace49d-0888-83e8-a5f1-a9277443ef84).
Before asking implementation-specific questions, push the current code and
provide the GitHub repository plus exact commit and relevant source links.

At this initial assessment no new NLO EEC contribution has been calculated and
no computational kernel has been launched. The completed normalization tests
are documented separately in [DerivedNormalizations.md](DerivedNormalizations.md).

## Development progress

The framework baseline was pushed as `77953eca` and supplied to actual GPT-6 Pro.
Pro completed the mathematical review and then confirmed inspection of that
exact public revision. Its assessment distinguishes existing general cut
definitions from the missing physical integrations and NNLO orchestration.
See [the review summary](../../External/ChatGPT/Records/2026-09-18/02_nlo_eec_strategy.md).

The user further requires obtaining and saving our own complete coefficient
before comparing with published EEC coefficients. No such comparison has been
performed for the new order. Keep this order of work in subsequent follow-ups.

Implemented general two-, three- and four-body invariant phase-space coordinates
in `FeynFacet/Integrals/Parametric/InvariantPhaseSpace.wl`. The four-body chart uses
two cluster decays with dimensional angular measures. Fifteen checks passed,
including absolute volume and a nonconstant moment at epsilon=0 and -1/2
(84.45 s including startup). This is physical integration geometry, not a solved
measured master or a final result. High precision quadrature emitted convergence
warnings while resolving these checks beyond their required tolerance.

Tuple preparation now simplifies the common unmeasured density before attaching
each weight and cut Jacobian. It preserves original off-shell ordinary
propagators and checks their prescriptions. Rational coefficient collection
treats dimensional scale powers as coefficients, avoiding a silent failure of
the optional numerator cancellation. The existing three-body integration check
passes (18.52 s), and sixteen four-body direct/shared-density and causal checks
pass (18.94 s). These are internal checks, not published NLO coefficient tests.

Cards now enumerate the unit-charge current over nf degenerate flavors, with
qqbgg, identical four-quark and distinct four-quark state sums. Born/real/virtual
cards share that flavor definition. NNLO real-virtual and both two-body virtual
amplitude orders are declared; their new integrations are still unimplemented.
Six state-counting and card checks passed in 15.47 s, including the automatically
derived nf, nf/4 and nf(nf-1)/2 contributions before the appropriate gluon factor.

The current owned production attempt is the qqbgg preparation:
`Raw/NNLO/q-qb/DoubleReal/Work/Components/Gluons/Prepare.log` and `Prepare.json`.
It uses CPU indices 0..6, reserving CPU 7 for small independent development checks.
The driver is `Scripts/run_measured_contribution.wls`, stage `prepare`, with
compiled component `DoubleReal.Gluons`. Its actual files live in the nested
component `Work` directory. Earlier interrupted/failed attempts are retained
alongside the launch log; they are not successful production timings. Inspect
the receipt and process list before starting another attempt. No measured DE
or order-alpha_s-squared coefficient has yet completed.
